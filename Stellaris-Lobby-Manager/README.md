# Setllaris Lobby Manager

A desktop app that manage and configures stellaris lobby settings.

## Features
- Quick save/load lobby settings
- <font size="4">***SUPPORT MULTIPLAER LOBBY FOR HOST***</font>
- Can exceed setting step, upper and lower bound limit, allow you to set the value as precise as game allows
- Lock or ignore setting configure
- Auto detect game launch/exit (but probably not a good idea leaving this app open while playing)

## Why?
- All starts from that game where I want 5 fallen empire at small sized map but too lazy to find a mod

## Requirements
- .NET 6.0
- win-x64

## Note
- Non host player will not able to see setting changes made from this app, please notify them :)
- Any setting that exceed the game limit might cause unexpected behavior, too low/high value might casuing game stuck at loading, crashing or not configured properly, use at your own risk
- Except this app to be broken after game update, it will take time to fix
